            Raven was born the half-breed daughter of a human mother named
            Angela Roth and the demon overlord Emperor Trigon. She was conceived
            when her mother ran away from home and joined a cult, which then
            summoned the demon lord Trigon. Angela Roth, going by Arella,
            retreated to an alternate dimension where Raven was born and raised
            in the pacifistic reality called Azarath. Growing up, Raven was
            taught to control her emotions by the Azar and the Azarathian monks
            in order to suppress and control her inherited demonic powers.
            Eventually, she learned that Trigon was planning to come to her
            dimension and vowed to stop him. She initially approached the
            Justice League, but they refused her on the advice of Zatanna who
            sensed her demonic parentage. In desperation, she reformed the
            Titans as the New Teen Titans to fight her father.
