            Superman was born on the fictional planet Krypton with the birth
            name of Kal-El. As a baby, his parents sent him to Earth in a small
            spaceship shortly before Krypton was destroyed. His ship landed in
            the town of Smallville, Kansas. He was found and adopted by farmers
            Jonathan and Martha Kent, who named him Clark Kent. Clark began
            developing superhuman abilities. His adoptive parents advised him to
            use his powers to help humanity, and he decided to fight crime as a
            vigilante. To protect his personal life, he uses the alias
            &quot;Superman&quot; when fighting crime. Clark resides in the city
            of Metropolis, where he works as a journalist for the Daily Planet.
            Superman&#39;s love interest-later wife and fellow journalist is
            Lois Lane. His archenemy is Lex Luthor. Other enemies include
            Brainiac, General Zod, and Darkseid.
