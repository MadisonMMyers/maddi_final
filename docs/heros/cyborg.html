            Saved by his scientist father after an accident left very little of
            Victor’s body intact, Dr. Silas Stone used all of his advanced
            scientific knowledge to save his only child’s life. Although he
            always exhibited a genius-level intellect, young Victor Stone didn’t
            want a life dedicated to science and research like his parents.
            Instead, Vic dreamed of being a football player and devoted all of
            his time to becoming a star athlete while he was still in high
            school. But a tragic twist of fate that should have left him dead
            instead found him becoming part man and part machine. He always
            carried a sadness within him. Vic Stone is a member of the Teen
            Titans and also becomes a member of the Justice League.
