            Salde is the world&#39;s best and most expensive mercenary. When he
            was 16 he lied about his age and joined the army. He met his wife
            Adeline Kane who trained him to be the best fighter. Wilson
            volunteered for a medical experiment designed to stimulate his
            adrenal gland in the hopes of increasing a soldier&#39;s ability.
            The experiment did not go as expected, and Slade fell into a coma.
            When he awakened, he discovered that he was now capable of using 90%
            of his brain capacity, and his strength, durability, and agility
            were increased to near-superhuman levels. After mercenaries kill one
            of his sons, leading to his wife leaving him, he starts to use his
            abilities as a mercenary himself. He is a known enemy of The Teen
            Titans and Beast Boy.
